**** Changes pushed on Thurs July 13, 2023

1) Engquist Majda absorbing boundary conditions added ( -bc=a in selected cmd files )

2) SuperGrid absorbing layers added ( -useSuperGrid=1, and -bc=a in selected cmd files )

3) WaveHoltz for complex solutions implemented. 
   The direct Helmholtz solver in solveHelmholtzDirect.bC will also compute the complex Helmholtz solution.

4) Option for linear damping added to wave equation (for testing complex WaveHoltz solution)

5) New regression test directories:
       checkWave/      : checks for wave solver 
       checkEigen/     : checks for EigenWave
       checkWaveHoltz/ : checks for WaveHoltz
   Type 'make check-quiet' from main directory to run all tests

6) Fourth-order implicit time-stepping added (needs more checking)

7) Fixed order=2 implicit scheme and monolithic implicit upwind dissipation

8) All upwind dissipation coefficients are now computed in a single place:
     CgWave::getUpwindDissipationCoefficient(..)   ( function found in CgWave.C )

9) Added option to plot scattered field (needs checking)
    See implementation in plot.bC
    See runs/known/known.cmd : -plotScatteredField=1

10) "exact" boundary conditions with explicit or implicit time-stepping should work now.
