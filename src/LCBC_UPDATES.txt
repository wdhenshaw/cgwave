===== Information regarding LCBC updates =====

==== JULY 24 Update ============

- LCBC class goes to order 8 in accuracy
- LCBC class supports the input of flexible grid sizes of data grid functions (coefficients, forcing, boundary)
- Faster implementation due to significant changes in numerical differentiation (can be made faster still)
- LCBC class supports Neumann BCs on Cartesian Grids
- LCBC class supports Neumann BCs on Curvilinear Grids if the boundary operator is provided as a function pointer. (Note: I plan to change this to data grid function input but this needs time. We need to decide on an appropriate time to do that)
- Bug fix: in LCBC_data.C file, the function fixData (which extrapolates values of forcing and coefficients on extra ghost points needed) had incorrect limits in two of the for loops which caused the 6th-order LCBC implementation to gives order 5 accuracy on a box domain.

====================================================================================================

- LCBC class now supports periodic BCs with Dirichlet BCs as long as the solution is provided at the periodic boundary from ((-p), ..., (numOfGridPoints + p)). Edges and corners of two adjacent periodic faces must be updated before using LCBC (The current class does not update a periodic-periodic edge or corner.) - Apr 22, 2022 

- Coefficient implementation inside LCBC class updates coefficients at physical faces only instead of all faces. - Apr 19, 2022
