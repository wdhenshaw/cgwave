===== Information regarding testLCBC file =====

testLCBC.C : 

- LCBC class now supports periodic BCs with Dirichlet BCs as long as the solution is provided at the periodic boundary from ((-p), ..., (numOfGridPoints + p)). Edges and corners of two adjacent periodic faces must be updated before using LCBC (The current class does not update a periodic-periodic edge or corner.) - Apr 22, 2022 

- Coefficient implementation inside LCBC class updates coefficients at physical faces only instead of all faces. - Apr 19, 2022 

- Neumann Boundary support: pending... 
- User Options for grid function data input (forcing, boundary and PDE coefficients): pending... 

             
===== Needed LCBC files =====

LCBC.h              (contains the LCBC class)
LCBC.C              (contains initialize function and updateGhost function)
LCBC1.C             (contains functions that set up the LCBC matrices at a face)
LCBC2.C             (contains functions that set up the RHS for the LCBC system at a face)
LCBC_corner.C       (contains functions for the LCBC implementation at a 2D corner or 3D edge)
LCBC_vertex.C       (contains functions for the LCBC implementation at a 3D corner)
LCBCmacros.h        (contains the macros used in the LCBC class)

grid.h              (grid class used in LCBC class)
utility.C           (utility functions used in LCBC class)
utility.h                
numericalDeriv.C    (contains functions to compute numerical derivatives)
numericalDeriv.h    (contains the numerical derivative class used in LCBC class)

===== header to use LCBC class =====

#include "LCBC.h"

===== Note regarding annulus map (temporary) =====

need the files: LCBC_annulusMap.C, LCBC_annulusMap.h            
add the header: #include "LCBC_annulusMap.h"

(I only use the function annulus_Cn which a function pointer to the coefficients of the Laplacian operator in parameter space)
